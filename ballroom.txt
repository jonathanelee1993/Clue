The ballroom is very large and spacious.
The walls and the painting hung on them are very intricate, and the floor is made of marble.
At the north end of the room is a stage.
In your head you imagine a get together of England's most elite occuring in this room,
wishing you could have been born in a high enough status to be invited to such a ball.
