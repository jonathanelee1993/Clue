In the center of the kitchen is a large, sturdy table.
Along the perimeters of the room are the storage furniture, the stove, and the sink.
There is plenty of open space, there to allow multiple cooks to be able to do work
in this kitchen at once. Indeed, that is the kind of work that would be necessary
to feed the multiple guests that are normally found here on the day of a ball
or a banquet.
