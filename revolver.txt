From your knowledge of Victorian-era weapons, you conclude that this is an Enfield revolver,
a type officially used in the British military services between 1880 and 1911.
This particular one still looks to be in a very useable condition. You wonder why
a good weapon such as this would have been lying on the floor of this mansion unattended...
