In this library there are multiple bookcases filled with books and papers lying on all of the desks.
On many of the chairs are books with bookmarks placed in the pages or still sprawled open.
As spotless and showy as the rest of the mansion is, you are very relieved to find one room
that is not so tidy. It actually makes you feel very much at home, where you would normally,
at this time of night, lay on a chair and read a good mystery novel until you fall asleep...
