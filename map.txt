The map is oriented by a typical compass (north is up, south is down, east is right, and west is left). The mansion is divided into a 3 by 3 grid with 9 rooms. 
The rooms in the top row (from left to right) are the kitchen, the ballroom, and the conservatory, in the middle row (from left to right) are the billiard room,
the library, and the study, and in the bottom row (from left to right) are the lounge, the hall, and the dining room. Jutting south from the hall is a long
corridor that connects the front door to the rest of the mansion.
