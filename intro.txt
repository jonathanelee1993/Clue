It is the year 1926. You are standing outside of the Tudor Mansion in Hampshire, England, on a cold, stormy night.
There has recently been a murder here, and it is your job to solve the mystery.
The suspect is one of the following six people: Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White, Reverend Green, Mrs. Peacock, or Professor Plum. 
The murder obviously must have occured in one of the nine rooms of the estate (the kitchen, the ballroom, the conservatory, the billiard room,
the library, the study, the lounge, the hall, or the dining room), and from initial observation you have gathered that the weapon used
must have been one of the following weapons found within the mansion: a candlestick, a knife, a lead pipe, a revolver, a rope, or a wrench.
It is up to you to figure out this mystery. Explore the rooms within this mansion: you may be able to find some clues. May the best of luck be with you.
